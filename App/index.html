          I am in charge of collecting information, user data, and any other
          pertinent sources for our project, since I am quite confident in my
          research and analytical abilities. I conducted research to find FAQ
          data, information from the Student Connect, as well as helpful tools
          for creating the bot. In addition, I am responsible for making the
          Powerpoint presentation that would be utilised to convey our project
          proposal to the instructor and the class.

          To function the chatbot, I will be working on the back-end. Due to the
          complicated work regarding building code and database management, I
          also share the work with Dat, our supervisor. With the collected data
          for the FAQ, we feed information and program the bot to create
          responses for users. In addition, a comprehensive and informative
          response was prioritised, so they were prudent with the responses to
          give users their best experience.

          that I have a keen eye and a passion for the visual side of things.
          That is why I am responsible for UI/UX creation and also front-end
          development. This is also the career that I want to pursue in the
          future.

        <p>TOPIC</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As our society's technology gets more and more advanced everyday,
          hundreds of applications are now using higher technology to improve
          the quality of our lives. To contribute to these improvements, we
          decided that an automatic bot for the RMIT Student Connect website and
          a revamp of the site's visuals would be essential for RMIT to keep up
          with the technology advancements. With features such as answering
          Frequently Asked Questions or reserving library rooms without the need
          of going through administrators, the bot is named “Ringo the RMIT
          helper”.

        <p>MOTIVATION</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As we are all freshmen of RMIT (Khôi excluded), we also found the
          orientation experience a bit puzzling as a lot of things were new -
          which room to be in, which class we should take, how to allocate a
          subject and so forth. We are sure that the amount of questions will
          keep arising as the semester progresses. So to combat this problem,
          “Ringo” was created to make the orientation experience smoother for
          future students of RMIT.

        <p>LANDSCAPE</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          We know that there is already an existing Student Connect website.
          However, our project's aim is not to compete with it but to refine and
          update the webpage to be more suited, flexible and user-friendly.

        <p>AIMS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As students of RMIT, our project's main objective is to help other
          students with the process of adapting to university life. The reason
          why this is our main target is that we have also been through and felt
          a bit confused on the first day of learning in a new environment. As a
          result, we decided that by refining and revamping the Student Connect
          website, we hope it would drastically change how future students adapt
          to RMIT.

        <p>SCOPE AND LIMITS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          The feature that stands out most about our project is the FAQ, as it
          is the focal point of our website as it will be the most used
          function. As it is essential for new students to adapt to university
          life. They will be able to deal with specific concerns about their
          majors, subject and school in general.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          The purpose of the second function, the tutor and processor
          appointment booking is mainly to give students easy access to
          consultation which will greatly benefit the student's academic
          performance.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          To improve student's team working skills and make it easier for
          students to arrange face-to-face meetings, we have also added a
          booking system for meeting rooms in our school. Without the hassle of
          going through the administrator, this function will eliminate a lot of
          workload.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Last but not least the function that allows students to connect with a
          live agent will resolve certain issues that will need direct
          communication. Cause we cannot expect to have every answer that is
          available.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          In terms of coding work, because we focus mainly on the back-end of
          the website, we keep it simple when it comes to the front-end, by
          using minimal design elements, and use less animation.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>TESTING</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Our final project must follow these criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The website must run smoothly, without any bugs and always be
            available to all students
          </li>
          <li>Users has little to none hassle interacting with the website</li>
          <li>
            The bot will have no delay when a users is using it and answer all
            questions correctly
          </li>
          <li>Multiple users can use the website without any lag or crashes</li>
          <li>
            The website will be appealing the users and can run on all device
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description-text">
          With these requirements in mind, we created test cases to ensure all
          of them will be met. We are also planning to have a meeting to test
          the website with our class. Any bugs or problems will be reported and
          resolved as soon as possible. Moreover, we will also collect their
          opinion on the website in terms of front-end and other aspects of the
          website to further refine and complete our product.
        </p>

      <article>
        <p>RISKS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Due to the amount of risks, we would definitely consider this to be
          one of the most serious projects that we have done so far in regards
          to programming.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The lack of experience in our group</li>
          <p class="description-text">
            All of us have little to no experience in the field of creating a
            website. All members of our group just started taking coding classes
            and there will be a lot of learning and applying on the way. However
            we believe that this is a lifelong process and this knowledge will
            be used often in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            To combat this, we allocate the first few weeks to learn certain
            aspects, getting consultation and making drafts. On top of that we
            will also be researching and getting a lot of help from outside
            sources such as the internet, tutors, and professors.
          </p>
          <li>Trying to improve a totally usable website</li>
          <p class="description-text">
            The Student Connect website is the main objective of our project,
            which has little issues. As a result, we are setting a very high
            standard. Moreover, we are also trying to revamp the website, making
            it more appealing to users which is very challenging.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            We will refine the website with the new features from our bot and
            add catchy design for decoration. More time in the testing and
            quality assurance stage will also be needed
          </p>
          <li>Performance rate</li>
          <p class="description-text">
            Due to the high usage rate of the Student Connect. We have to make
            sure to maintain a well-built website.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            We understand that visitors expect a fast, responsive and reliable
            website. Falling to meet these expectations can be detrimental to
            the usefulness of the website. In order to combat these issue, here
            are some possible solutions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Upgrading to a more reliable hosting server that boast higher
              capacity and faster connection
            </li>
            <li>Streamline our site design</li>
            <li>Improve security</li>

        <p>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATION</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          We will be mainly working together by meeting up at school together
          with group sessions on Discord.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          We will conduct one face to face meeting per week at school to update
          on each other's progress, lay out the upcoming tasks and also review
          our work. We will go through every single idea from eac member and
          choose out the best knees to add onto the project. Questions such as
          “How can we improve the product?” or “How can we streamline our
          process?” will be posed during these meetings. In the event that face
          to face meetings can't be conducted, online meetings will be held on
          Discord. Other than that, our main communication platform will be
          Messenger. Finalised ideas will be recorded on a separate folder of
          documents on Google Docs. Lastly, frequently used files are hosted and
          shared on Google Drive for ease of access.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Files that are not code-related will be saved on a shared Drive
          folder. All things code-related are posted to a GitHub repository.
