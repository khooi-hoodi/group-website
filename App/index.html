          I am in charge of collecting information, user data, and any other
          pertinent sources for our project, since I am quite confident in my
          research and analytical abilities. I conducted research to find FAQ
          data, information from the Student Connect, as well as helpful tools
          for creating the bot. In addition, I am responsible for making the
          Powerpoint presentation that would be utilised to convey our project
          proposal to the instructor and the class.

          complicated work regarding building code and database management, I
          also share the work with Dat, our supervisor. With the collected data
          for the FAQ, we feed information and program the bot to create
          responses for users. In addition, a comprehensive and informative
          response was prioritised, so me and Dat were prudent with the
          responses to give users their best experience.

          components, and how they interact during development, and bring them
          together into a finished product. On the RMIT career path for our
          team, Son decides to expand his knowledge of his minor by taking
          courses such as Web Development Technologies and Full Stack
          Development. If feasible, Son will also enroll in online courses like

          Khoi's dream is to specialise in any career that bridges the gap
          between programming and art. After his first year as a Design student
          in RMIT, he quicked realised that being a full-time designer might not
          be the best choice for him as he was quite struggling in class. He
          then took an interest in programming after one of his friends
          introduced him to his first programming language ever, JavaScript.
          Using his proficiency in programming and his passion for art, he would
          be suitable for jobs that require both discipline and creativity.
          Anything from a front-end developer to a game developer would fit him
          perfectly.

          little similarity between our careers except for the fact that they
          are all in the IT sector. However, all these career paths are showing
          good trends for the future and we believe that we would be fulfilled
          in our different jobs.

        <p>TOPIC</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As our society's technology gets more and more advanced everyday,
          hundreds of applications are now using higher technology to improve
          the quality of our lives. To contribute to these improvements, we
          decided that an automatic bot for the RMIT Student Connect website and
          a revamp of the site's visuals would be essential for RMIT to keep up
          with the technology advancements. With features such as answering
          Frequently Asked Questions or reserving library rooms without the need
          of going through administrators, the bot is named “Ringo the RMIT
          helper”.

        <p>MOTIVATION</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As we are all freshmen of RMIT (Khôi excluded), we also found the
          orientation experience a bit puzzling as a lot of things were new -
          which room to be in, which class we should take, how to allocate a
          subject and so forth. We are sure that the amount of questions will
          keep arising as the semester progresses. So to combat this problem,
          “Ringo” was created to make the orientation experience smoother for
          future students of RMIT.

        <p class="description-text">
          We know that there is already an existing Student Connect website.
          However, our project's aim is not to compete with it but to refine and
          update the webpage to be more suited, flexible and user-friendly.

        <p>AIMS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          As students of RMIT, our project's main objective is to help other
          students with the process of adapting to university life. The reason
          why this is our main target is that we have also been through and felt
          a bit confused on the first day of learning in a new environment. As a
          result, we decided that by refining and revamping the Student Connect
          website, we hope it would drastically change how future students adapt
          to RMIT.

        <p>PLAN & PROGRESS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          For our project, we have progressed on many parts, specifically
          researching and designing (front-end and back-end).
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">BRAINSTORMING</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right from the start, we had an abundance of ideas</li>
          <li>Narrowing the options down to just one was the difficult part</li>
          <li>
            We set out criterias for our ideas: Doable within the timeframe, and
            that it would solve a problem closely related to us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description-text">RESEARCH & PLANNING</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To come up with an appropriate plan of action, we had to block out
            an entire week to research and test the potential ways that could
            carry out this project.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description-text">PROGRESS</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Of course things didn't go as planned, some weeks our progress
            stalled because of unfortunate circumstances, be it medical
            emergencies, other projects getting in the way, family emergencies,
            etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only until we started implementing each of the bot's function did we
            realize its complexity
          </li>
          <p class="description-text">BACK-END</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After a week of learning Django, we came to the realization that
              it would have been impossible for us to make a fully functional
              chatbot with our limited time and skills. Consequently, we had to
              look for other options, that is when we landed on Dialogflow
            </li>
            <li>
              Dialogflow was both easy to understand and effective for bots'
              instant response, so we began by implementing the FAQ and booking
              functions. Since we just had to submit the user's expression and
              the bot's answer, FAQ was not a key concern, thus digging up its
              data was prioritized. The booking function, however, placed us in
              a situation, as the bot would neither enable us to book straight
              from it nor utilize a hyperlink to get to the booking website.
              Therefore, we developed a bit.ly URL directing us to a booking
              website. Originally the booking feature was meant to work with
              Google Sheets, however, in order to do that, we had to learn
              SheetDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, we had to scale down in order to fit within the time
              frame. To be specific, our FAQ feature was limited to only 2
              categories. Another feature that was canceled was the live agent
              handoff. It turned out to require a paid service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="description-text">FRONT-END</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We have no prior knowledge of how to create a website apart from
              the fact that we know it is created using two main languages: HTML
              and CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              At first, we decided to learn these languages together with JS and
              preferably JS Frameworks.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the end, we decided that this would take too much time, and we
              ended up learning only the most necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, this allowed us to do everything within our capabities
              and explores our options a bit more. We were proud of what we
              created visual-wise with our limited knowledge.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="description-text">FINAL PRODUCT</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Our final product, though does not 100% resemble our intentions, is a
          good portrayal of our efforts. Many of our plans did not carry out
          both because of the the time curve and the learning curve. However, a
          lot of the features did make it to the prototype:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The FAQ was a feature in the bot, albeit at a smaller scale.</li>
          <li>
            The bot was able to book meeting rooms using the school's Outlook
            Calendar
          </li>
          <li>
            There is voice recognition for the bot, which is bonus feature that
            we did not expect nor think of it.
          </li>
          <li>The web is mobile responsive, to an extent.</li>
          <li>
            The web does include a bit of responsiveness for the hamburger menu.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>SCOPE AND LIMITS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          The feature that stands out most about our project is the FAQ, as it
          is the focal point of our website as it will be the most used
          function. As it is essential for new students to adapt to university
          life. They will be able to deal with specific concerns about their
          majors, subject and school in general.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          The purpose of the second function, the tutor and processor
          appointment booking is mainly to give students easy access to
          consultation which will greatly benefit the student's academic
          performance.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          To improve student's team working skills and make it easier for
          students to arrange face-to-face meetings, we have also added a
          booking system for meeting rooms in our school. Without the hassle of
          going through the administrator, this function will eliminate a lot of
          workload.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Last but not least the function that allows students to connect with a
          live agent will resolve certain issues that will need direct
          communication. Cause we cannot expect to have every answer that is
          available.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          In terms of coding work, because we focus mainly on the back-end of
          the website, we keep it simple when it comes to the front-end, by
          using minimal design elements, and use less animation.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>TESTING</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Our final project must follow these criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The website must run smoothly, without any bugs and always be
            available to all students
          </li>
          <li>Users has little to none hassle interacting with the website</li>
          <li>
            The bot will have no delay when a users is using it and answer all
            questions correctly
          </li>
          <li>Multiple users can use the website without any lag or crashes</li>
          <li>
            The website will be appealing the users and can run on all device
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description-text">
          With these requirements in mind, we created test cases to ensure all
          of them will be met. We are also planning to have a meeting to test
          the website with our class. Any bugs or problems will be reported and
          resolved as soon as possible. Moreover, we will also collect their
          opinion on the website in terms of front-end and other aspects of the
          website to further refine and complete our product.

      <article>
        <p>RISKS</p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Due to the amount of risks, we would definitely consider this to be
          one of the most serious projects that we have done so far in regards
          to programming.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The lack of experience in our group</li>
          <p class="description-text">
            All of us have little to no experience in the field of creating a
            website. All members of our group just started taking coding classes
            and there will be a lot of learning and applying on the way. However
            we believe that this is a lifelong process and this knowledge will
            be used often in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            To combat this, we allocate the first few weeks to learn certain
            aspects, getting consultation and making drafts. On top of that we
            will also be researching and getting a lot of help from outside
            sources such as the internet, tutors, and professors.
          </p>
          <li>Trying to improve a totally usable website</li>
          <p class="description-text">
            The Student Connect website is the main objective of our project,
            which has little issues. As a result, we are setting a very high
            standard. Moreover, we are also trying to revamp the website, making
            it more appealing to users which is very challenging.
          </p>

          Outlook Calendar in order to power the bot's appointment feature. Due
          to the length of the Booking link, Bitly was used to shorten it.. In

        I can proudly say that all members of my team did their job very well.
        Though we face a lot of challenges. For example, the test cases of the
        chat bot, the visual additions decisions, or the fact that we have to
        complete a full detailed report for the project. I had a great time with
        the team and felt that we've all tried and did our best. With this being
        the most serious project I have ever done because we have set a
        high-ceiling of refining and revamping the Student Connect website. I
        feel very satisfied with our final prototype, as it is fully functional
        and looks very appealing. However, we still have a vast amount of
        functions and additions that we can't add to the website due to the lack
        of time. Such as the live agent function and the many animation elements
        of the website. All in all, This project has taught me how to work
        better with a team and time-managing skills. Moreover, the fact that we
        have to handle problems and issues in a short amount of time has made me
        more flexible for my future career and I will be looking forward to
        doing more projects to further improve myself.

        I was very fortunate to be a part of such a great team for this project.
        My experience really showed me the impact of good teamwork. Throughout
        the project, even though we faced a lot of unexpected obstacles, good
        teamwork has allowed us to tackle them with ease. As freshmen, it is no
        surprise that a lack of expertise posed a serious challenge for us.
        However, by utilizing our different skill sets and dividing the tasks
        based on each individual's strengths, we were able to have a successful
        outcome. What this means is during a project, a lot of things could go
        wrong but good teamwork is the key factor in determining whether it is a
        successful project. I could speak with certainty that open communication
        and regular meetings have greatly contributed to the success of Ringo.
        It was the diverse perspectives and experiences of each team member that
        led to the outcome. Even though I had known of the importance of
        teamwork beforehand, working in this team allowed me to experience those
        benefits firsthand, which further convinced me of the idea. In the
        future, I will emphasize good teamwork practices during a group project.
        Furthermore, continuing to work on my own teamwork skills is the obvious
        path of action.

        Being a member of this fantastic team and doing what I could do best was
        an incredible experience. As freshmen, our team encountered several
        obstacles while commencing the project, namely a lack of specialized
        chatbot expertise. Communication and research proved to be our answer.
        We identified each individual's abilities and used them to complete our
        own tasks within the group. After weeks of communication and team
        sessions, our prototype is beginning to come together. We had a
        significant issue with time management, since we were not totally
        focused on every phase of the project. We resolved the issue by
        increasing the frequency of offline meetings and work reviews. I was
        rather astonished by how much I had to study and acquire during the
        duration of the project. Knowing the significance of communication and
        cooperation enabled me to choose what I should prioritize. Thanks to the
        unique viewpoints of each team member, I was able to manage my work and
        time in an effective manner. In addition, the manner in which we
        resolved all of the issues has made me more adaptable and self-assured
        for my future teamwork-based endeavors. I'm looking forward to working
        on more projects in the future.

      <p class="description-text">
        As the senior in the group, I feel like I have a certain responsibility
        to guide my fellow newbies. However, my abilities are definitely
        limited, and in terms of programming and information technology, I do
        not have any experience whatsoever, contrary to the future IT graduates
        in my team. I have to say that I was worried since I already experience
        both second hand and first hand the hardships of teamwork. At the end of
        the day, I am proud of my team and how these guys handle each and every
        situation, with and without my help. All of us do not have any
        experience prior to this, but we split the job into multiple sections,
        each of us learning a different part of the project that we want to do
        in the future. I have always wanted to be able to do websites visuals on
        my own, but I have never had the chance nor the experience and knowledge
        in order to be able to do it. This project has definitely given me the
        push that I need in order to complete the most daunting programming task
        yet: my first project.
      </p>

      <p>GROUP REFLECTION</p>
      <p class="description-text">
        The project definitely could have ended up a lot worse than we expected.
        There were a lot of questions that needed to be answered but none of us
        quite know the answer: 3 of us were freshmen that were getting used to
        both the university life and the technology career path at the same
        time; another was a design student studying IT as a GE Course, so this
        is definitely not his expertise. However, step by step, we managed to
        pull something together as a team. Our first website and also our first
        IT project has to be one of the best experience yet. As for the
        freshmen, apart from the skills that they picked up during the creation
        of the website, they also grasped the very basics of how to research,
        how to allocate work, and most importantly how to operate as a team. As
        for the design major student, Khoi got to learn what he has always
        wanted to be able to do but did not have a community or the right
        incentive to push him forward. It is the experience in teamworking from
        a second-year in RMIT, the energy of the three freshmen, and more
        important than all, our trust for each other, that made this project a
        reality. We are forever grateful for each other and that we have made
        our first friends in our university. We are sure to have made mistakes
        along the way, both technical and non-technical, such as setting false
        expectations for what our website should look like. What the project has
        taught us is how small we are in the big IT world. Of course, our
        project does need improvements. One improvement from the front-end
        department is that the site should be more responsive and playful, as
        user-friendliness was one of our aims for the upgraded website. The next
        step for us front-end devs wannabes is to study JavaScript and some
        frameworks to go with it. A good start would be React. As for the
        back-end, the performance of the website can be improved. Moreover, we
        want to add the feature of relaying to a live agent whenever the bot is
        not able to solve the user's queries. Overall, the project was a success
        for all of us, and is a nice step towards our respective career paths.
